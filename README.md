- Sushi appeared in Japan a couple of hundred years ago. With the rise of Buddhism, the majority of Japan's population completely removed the meat from its diet, popularizing the fish even more. At the time, the fish was kept in barrels of wood with layers of cooked rice between the fillets of raw fish, because thanks to the fermentation of the rice which releases certain types of acids, guarantee their quality for a longer time, however, rice after its fermentation had to be discarded. This way of preserving fish, added to the abstention from meat, gradually became a dish, replacing acids from rice fermentation with vinegar and soy.

## Speech (Questioning Method)

- Now I wanted to ask anyone who liked Sushi to put their hands in the air.
- Among those who like Sushi: What is the type of sushi piece you like most?
- Most people like sushi but do not know, or rather, do not remember, for sure the names of the sushi pieces, so I am going to introduce you to the 6 most common ones.

- The pieces on the left are Temakis, pieces that we will have today the opportunity to not only make but also eat! They are essentially salmon cones wrapped in rice.
- To my right are Niguiris, pieces of rice covered with a slice of salmon on top. Whoever says salmon says any other kind of raw fish.
- On the left are Hosomakis, they are the simplest sushi rolls, they have only seaweed around the fish wrapped in the rice.
- On the right are Uramakis, equivalent to Hosomakis, but it is the rice that surrounds the seaweed instead of the algae that surrounds the rice.
- On the left is Sashimi, pure slices of raw fish.
- And finally on the right, gunkans, rolls in which the fish surrounds the rice.
